#gobridge

The aim of gobridge is to create a script which will watch games on IGS (the Internet go server) and replay the moves live on OGS (online go server). This would in particular be useful when pro games are broadcast at IGS, since it would allow the viewing of these games on OGS too. 

Currently nothing works and I am just trying to get to grips with how to access the servers by python. This is complicated by that fact that the OGS API is not completed (or maybe it is just the documentation) and the documentation for IGS seem to be partly lost in time.
